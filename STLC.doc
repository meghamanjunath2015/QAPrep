software testing lifecycle: 

Requirement Analysis : Understand and analyze the requirements to determine the scope of testing.

Test plan 

Closure and Maintaince:  Evaluate the testing process against the predefined objectives and prepare test closure reports
and results. Adding Maintaince process and Evaluate metrics 

Test plan: 
1. SOA - SCOPE, OBJECTIVES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
2. TEST STRATEGY -  testing types (e.g., functional, non-functional) 
3. TEST CASE DEVELOPMENT -  creation, verification and rework of test cases & test scripts
4. ENVIRNOMENT SETUP - Hardware requirements, software requirements like AWS setup, Automation tools used 
5. AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT
6. TEST SCHEDULE and TEST EXECUTION 
7. DEFECT MANAGMENT, RISKS and MITIGATION 
8. APPROVALS and APPENDICES 


Developing a QA automation framework ? 
1. Define SCOPE and OBJECTIVE 
2. SELECTING RIGHT TOOLING 
3. Framework Architecture: the structure of Configuartion files, test scripts, test data management, reporting mechanisms, and integration with other tools or systems.
main and test 
main - Configuartion folder - properties files -  These files store key-value pairs of configuration settings. They are commonly used to store settings such as browser configurations, timeouts, and environment URLs.
                            - json files - defining test data, environment configurations, and test case parameters
                            - initialization files - database connections and server configurations
       TDM folder           - test data management
       Libraries and Utilities folder - common Utilities, custom Utilities
                                        page elements along with the functionalities 
        test folders       -  according to pages 
                           - according to related features 
                           - according to sprint stories 
        report and integration folders - testrail/jira integration 
                                         allure or testng reports 
                                         circleci or jenkins integration files .yaml EXECUTION
                                         cucuumber reports 
                                         Apache POI (Excel reporting), pdfBoc (pdf)
4. Decide a design pattern that you will use 
5. Develop test libraries and test cases 
6. Implement reporting and logging 
7. integration with CI 
8. Parallel setup if neccessary 
9. Execute tests and analyze the results 
10. Maintaince
